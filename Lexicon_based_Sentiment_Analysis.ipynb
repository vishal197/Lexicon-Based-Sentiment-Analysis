              "      <td>perfect taste but texture  was pretty bad i was really disappointed with this mix. while mixing it, the consistency was just right, and the taste was perfect, there was a hint of maple. i added a little vanilla and i was so excited about the taste. after i made them, my mom tried one before i did and she spat it out and told me it still wasn't cooked all the way in the center.. so i tried one and found the same issue. then the next batch, i left on until they were more golden brown and crispier, and they were still very dough-y in the center. it was like eating raw dough. the only thing i really liked was the flavor, with maple syrup it was wonderful, because i made myself eat them not wanting to waste money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i usually love king arthur gf flour-i think it's amazing. i use it to bake a lot of regular things and substitute it for regular flour, but this pancake mix was a real letdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hope others have more luck than i did.</td>\n",
